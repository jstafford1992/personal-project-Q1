Description

I wanted to create a pokemon battle simulation. It searches through the API list of pokemon to get the data for the pokemon. Then iterates through its potential moves it can learn (at level 0 to shorten the list of possible moves to iterate through) the random number generator isn't too great since I do get repeats of moves quite often. Basic battle functionality works, stats are compared to give or take a 10% bonus into attack power depending on simple attack to defense and 10% accuracy made off of speed comparison (special attack to special defense as well). My type comparison function works well on double, half or normal damage, I haven't quite gotten the noDamage comparison to work yet. I boosted health to 1000 hp to make the battles a little more lengthy and satisfying. Due to my implementation.

Tech

I used the PokeAPI to get the sprites and data for pokemon and pokemon moves and then JavaScript for all the battle functionality.

WorkFlow

Used pivotal tracker to help utulize agile methodology.
