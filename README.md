I used the PokeAPI, HTML, JavaScript, and a few lines of CSS to build a pokemon battle simulation. After the pokemon has been selected the moves are automatically populated by what moves that pokemon can learn at age 0 (basically evaulating to what machines they learn or moves they are born with). The battle functionality works pretty well for the double and half damage attack bonuses. The no damage to features of some types hasn't been implemented correctly yet but I hope to get it there in a week or so. I compare the pokemon attack to opponents defense to give a 10% bonus whichever pokemon has the higher stat points. I do the same for accuracy as well. Also attack type is figured into attack function to allow for bonuses applied to 
power of the attack used. I am uncertain of how to set up the stats to effect damage in accordance to pokemon attack power and pokemon defense on top of the moves power itself. But hopefully I'll make some progress on that in the next few weeks. I currently have boosted the Hp to 1000 to make the battles a little more satisfying and last longer than just a turn or two. 
I used pivotal tracker to follow agile methodology to keep myself on track for completing the most important features by the deadline of our presentations on friday. 

I hope to implement a few more features into the battle functionality in the coming weeks. Such as a work around for people who select Ditto, whether unintentionally or on purpose. Implement the rest of my type functionality for they types of pokemon who are immune to certain types of attacks (electricity to ground, normal to ghost, etc).
